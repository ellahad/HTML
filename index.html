<h3>Swimming Pool Cleaning & Maintenance Tips</h3>
<li>Have you checked the water? </li>
<p>Water should be tested regularly, preferably two or three times a week, whether the pH is in balance, whether the
chlorine in the pool is in good proportion. Have a good water connection to the pool from an experienced plumbing
company. The pH should be just above the neutral value, between 7.2 and 7.6.</p>

<li>Have you balanced the degree of chemicals?</li>
<p> You tried things out and saw that some chemistry needed to be added. Did you do that? The most common bad thing that
owners do is to delay things and not adjust the chemical balance of the water. The outcome can be a major problem to
clean later.</p>

<li>Have you shocked the pool lately?</li>
<p> Even if you regularly adjust the chemical balance of the water in the pool, it is advisable to shock your pool with
chlorine shock from time to time. You need to follow the shocking instructions as they are different from the regular
use of chlorine. What we are trying to do with the shock chlorine is to remove the organic compounds that have evolved
in the pools.
</p>

<li>Have you checked the pump?</li>
<p> First, make sure the pump is running. If the pump pressure reaches 8-10 psi above normal (1-1.5 bar), we perform a
Backwash system. It usually takes about 3 minutes to complete the process, so soon we have a clean filter which means
that the pump will not overload during operation.</p>

<li> Have you cleaned or replaced your filter recently? </li>
<p>he filter should be cleaned every 4 to 6 months. Clean the debris from the filter, rinse the filter, let it dry, return
it – and that’s it.

You can also use a cleaning kit to clean the pool. You should have a brush with which you can remove the most stubborn
dirt. With the right cleaner you can destroy even the most resistant bacteria, and with accessories – you can retrieve
what you couldn’t previously clean. Likewise, there is a wide range of products and mixtures for descaling and organic
impurities, located at the edges of the pool and accumulating during the bathing season. </p>
